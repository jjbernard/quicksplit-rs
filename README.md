# QuickSplit

This simple tool is my first attempt at a useful (for me at least) Rust program. What does it do:
- It's a command line tool that will take a directory of the for `2024-01-01` and turns it into a directory structure of the form `2024/01/01`
- It will copy the content from the old directory to the new directory
- It will delete the old directory
